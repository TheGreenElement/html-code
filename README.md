## Introduction

This repository is a couple of HTML code snippets that have been worked on by yours truly.

## Contents

The compilation includes HTML code snippets for the following functionalities:

- Simple drawing program with a brush, color picker, and eraser. (Broken)
- 3D Image Viewer. (That does not work)
- An art project that creates random "blobs" across the screen with varying sizes.
- Loads of games baked into one HTML file. (Kinda Bad)
- MegaBlitz, a malicious code file that when ran and accepted crashes Chromebooks.

## Usage

Feel free to browse the code snippets in this repository and use them in your projects as needed. Each HTML file is self-contained and can be copied directly into your project or opened in a web browser for testing.

To run the HTML files locally, you:

Download and run using Ctrl+O on a browser.
(To my knowledge, this only applies to Chromebooks)

## Contributing

Contributions to this compilation are welcome! If you have additional HTML code snippets that you think would be fun to include, feel free to open a pull request with your changes.

Before contributing, please double check it works, and make sure these snippets are specifically for Chromebooks.
